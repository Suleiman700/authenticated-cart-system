## Known Problems

There are some small known problems with the project.

---

#### <ins>Notifications</ins>

Sometimes the notification shows more than one time (duplicated)

This problem does not affect the server or the client, Its just a problem with the used notification module.

Due to the lack of time, I don't have the enough time to fix it.

#### <ins>Stored Login Sessions</ins>

The stored logged-in users sessions in `DB` does not have `expiration time`.

Due to the lack of time, I don't have the enough time to fix it.
