## Known Problems

There are some small known problems with the project.

---

#### <ins>Notifications</ins>

Sometimes the notification shows more than one time (duplicated)

This problem does not affect the server or the client, Its just a problem with the used notification module.

Due to the lack of time, I don't have the enough time to fix it.

#### <ins>Stored Login Sessions</ins>

The stored logged-in users sessions in `DB` does not have `expiration time`.

Due to the lack of time, I don't have the enough time to fix it.

#### <ins>Not Working Sidebar In Mobile Version</ins>

In desktop version, The header works just fine, But in the mobile version the header will contain (hamburger menu) and
it does not work.

The main purpose of sidebar menu is to navigate to `home` or `cart` page

This problem does not affect the server or the client.

Due to the lack of time, I don't have the enough time to fix it.
